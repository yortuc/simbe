# Roadmap for 2020

It's already May, 4 months from 2020 is gone, still we have 8 month left in front of us. 

### Professional Work

I am currently working in BMW Autonomous Driving Campus, on drive analytics. Drive analytics is driving statistics from real drive data. So We need to match logical scenarios like `cut-in` in real driving data and extract concrete scenarios. 

**Domain knowledge**

- Read papers and books about safety of autonomous vehicles and take detailed notes which will be converted into blog posts for this blog :)
-- Test Specifications for Highly Automated Driving Functions: Highway Pilot (read+, notes+, post-)
--


**Software engineering**

- Work regularly on some source code for an opensource project (Spark is the biggest candidate)
- Analyse the execution plans for the Spark Jobs at hand and try to optimize. (Cache, refactor, to speed up)
- Analyze memory and CPU requirements and best utilization of Yarn cluster.

### Interest topics

**Books I want to read**
This year I want to read more books. The books on my list so far:

- Creative Selection
- Algorithms Illuminated: Part 1,2,3
- 

**Algorithm Studies**
I did the half of the Leetcode's 30 days of code challenge. Finish this and document the solutions in details. 

### Side Projects

My biggest hobby is also programming. I always loved working on even very irrelevant side projects. But, I aslo have a habit of starting many projects and finishing none of them. And remmember the motto: `Stop starting, start finishing`. For this year I want to keep the list small.
I will write detailed descriptions of each in the near future.

- Logical scenario matching from video (OpenCV, Yolo and some magic) 
- Music composer assistant (Ludwig, seq2seq, music21)
- Programmable drawing app for iPad (Fabric.js, knockout ...)

# A Developer's Apology

### 1. The joy to share

When I was like in highschool, I had a web site. Coded and crafted by hand (and with the help Macromedia Dreamweaver). I treated it like a newspaper, some magazine. I used to research on some topic and assembl an article or translate some articles from English to Turkish (the site was in my native language). 

I had also an English teaching section that you can find material to learn English. And some 'dynamic' tests and whatsoever. I got really good feedback especially on this section. Even one guy said that, "I cannot affor a private English teacher for my kid, but the help of your web site he learns...". That was worth worlds actually, even myself was a very young highschool kid. 

So coming back to 2020, maybe 24 years after. I still do not have that web site again, back. And, now, in this very moment I am getting that back. 



### 2. Quality Issues
	
Ok, maybe you are like me maybe not. But the entire world is not watching and waiting to criticise what we write. And considering the fact that I am not the best engineer in the world (not yet), it's ok to make 'some' mistakes and learn from them. Actually what we need is to make more mistakes. Like training a artificial neural network. 

So, I will share even unfinished articles I started. Maybe this will create some motivation to finish them. 



### 3. Admiration and feel of progress

And also I admire couple of people who has (or used to have) vibrant blogs. Fatih Arslan, derin deli mavi, picostitch, ferruh mavituna are some of them. I admire that because a vibrant blog gives you the change to look back. Look back and see what you achieved, what you learned. 

For me, especially this is very important. I switched to different stacks in software development, and still doing some side projects in different technical focus areas like front-end, game-development, machine learning, programming language design and so on... So If I had kept even small posts about the areas that I worked on, I would have had lots of memories at hand. And now, like they have never existed. But no worries. I'll have them 5 years from now on. And maybe even show them to my kids. And what kids man! They are little monsters, atomic ants of their father. (the writers loses the focus here).

### 4. The Action

So, after I got motivated to get it all back, I thought about the fantasy to create a static site generator. How complicated it can be? To be hones, I thought I can pull that off in 10 minutes. I have a plan about creating a youtube channel and work on fun projects. But, in ten minutes. End to end. THis static site generator can be one of them I thought. 

Ok, I could not finish it in 10 minutes obviously, but still, it can be distilled down to very short amount of time. Because I had to spend time on planning and structure of the workflow. Once you have done that, the coding part still can be done in 10 minutes I believe. 

Here is the repo, [1 File static site generator](https://github.com/yortuc/simbe) I used to generate this site. Write your posts with markdown, and run compile. That's it. 

Other action items are:
1. Bring all the medium.com posts to this blog
2. Publish unfinished posts with [unfinished] tag. (stolen idea from picostitch)
3. Try blogging as much as you can!

### 5. Special Thanks

The first thing which made to think in this direction was to see and frined created a very simplistic static site generator, and started blogging intensively. Of course in a very professional way comparing with my good intended efforts. 


This is the tweet put me into action:
